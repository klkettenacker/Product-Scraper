### The Concept
Initially, the team want to formulate a web-based scrapper that will fetch data in a multiple section of E-Commerce inter-web content. Then the developers decide to settle on a single website source (lazada.com) to be presented in a single page website which is going to be our project.

### The Product-Scraper Website
The website is straight-forward to the user. It is a single-page website that displays the relevant Logitech Gaming Mice in Lazada.

### About the Web Scraper
The Web Scraping technology used was Scrapy along with the implementation of Scrapy-Splash and Splash in order to render the dynamic javascript elements in Lazada’s webpage. The project also uses JSONBin and its API as a small-scale database.
